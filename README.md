#Library Management System
##Context:
This system is designed to manage the day-to-day operations of a library. It helps librarians track book inventory, manage user accounts, and facilitate the borrowing and returning of books.

##Project Goal:
Create a web application that allows users to search for books, manage their accounts, and track borrowed books, while enabling librarians to manage inventory and user accounts effectively.
